# OpenThread Border Router

A Thread Border Router connects a Thread network to other IP-based networks, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

A Thread Border Router supports the following functions:

- End-to-end IP connectivity via routing between Thread devices and other external IP networks.
- Bidirectional DNS-based service discovery via mDNS (on a Wi-Fi/Ethernet link) and SRP (on a Thread network).
- DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to obtain IPv6 prefixes for a Thread network.
- NAT64 for connecting to IPv4 networks.
- External Thread Commissioning (for example, a mobile phone) to authenticate and join a Thread device to a Thread network.

OpenThread's implementation of a Border Router is called OpenThread Border Router (OTBR).
