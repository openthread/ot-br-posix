# OpenThread Border Router

Per the [Thread Specification](http://threadgroup.org/ThreadSpec), a Thread Border Router connects a Thread network to other IP-based networks, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. A Thread network requires a Border Router to connect to other networks.

A Thread Border Router minimally supports the following functions:

- End-to-end IP connectivity via routing between Thread devices and other external IP networks
- External Thread Commissioning (for example, a mobile phone) to authenticate and join a Thread device to a Thread network

OpenThread's implementation of a Border Router is called OpenThread Border Router (OTBR). **OTBR is a Thread Certified Component** on the Raspberry Pi 3B with a Nordic nRF52840 NCP.

OTBR includes a number of features, including:

- Web UI for configuration and management
- Thread Border Agent to support an External Commissioner
- DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to obtain IPv6 prefixes for a Thread network
- NAT64 for connecting to IPv4 networks
- Docker support

## Getting started

The quickest way to set up a Thread 1.3 compliant Border Router is to follow this codelab: [Thread Border Router - Bidirectional IPv6 Connectivity and DNS-Based Service Discovery](https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-border-router).

To run OTBR in a Docker container on any Linux-based system or a Raspberry Pi with either a physical or emulated NCP, please see the [Docker Support guide on openthread.io](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/docker) for more info.

OTBR also runs directly on supported platforms like the Raspberry Pi. If you're interested in building and configuring OTBR directly, or to learn more about the OTBR architecture, then see the rest of our end-user documentation at [openthread.io](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router).

> Note: For users in China, end-user documentation is available at [openthread.google.cn](https://openthread.google.cn/guides/border-router).
