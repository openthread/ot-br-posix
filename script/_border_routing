# This function disables IPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) in dhcpcd.
#
# dhcpcd on Raspberry Pi enables IPv6 support by default, including Router
# Solicitations (RS).  While we want to use dhcpcd for IPv6 address management,
# dhcpcd's handling of RS can conflict with the kernel's IPv6 configuration,
# specifically the 'accept_ra' setting.
#
# By disabling RS in dhcpcd with 'noipv6rs', we prevent dhcpcd from interfering
# with the kernel's 'accept_ra' setting, allowing us to manage IPv6 routing and
# other aspects of IPv6 configuration at the kernel level. This approach ensures
# that we can leverage dhcpcd for IPv6 address assignment while maintaining
# control over 'accept_ra'.
