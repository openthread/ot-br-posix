#  This script calls cmake and ninja to compile otbr-agent.
#
#  Compile with default build options:
#
#      script/cmake-build
#
#  Compile with the specified build option enabled:
#
#      script/cmake-build -D${option}=ON

#  Compile with the specified ninja build target:
#
#      OTBR_TARGET="${target}" script/cmake-build
#
#  Compile with the specified build directory:
#
#      OTBR_BUILD_DIR="./build/temp" script/cmake-build
