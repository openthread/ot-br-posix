# Add REST JSON:API for commissioner and diagnostics

## Summary

In this PR, we propose an extended `REST` API functionality providing capabilities for commissioning and on-mesh diagnostics to generic off-mesh http/https clients. The implementation is guided by the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/).

## Use Cases

The API targets following consumers and use cases:

- access to commissioning and network diagnostics for http/https clients with minimal code dependency (e.g. no ot-commissioner needed)
- field engineers for instant issue analysis and to visualize the mesh network topology
- continuous monitoring of network quality, eg. localisation of `weak` mesh regions
- developers for debugging and understanding network topology
- testers

A consumer may extract the data from the API and visualize it elsewhere.

## Background

- meshcop needs DTLS and Thread specific sources or binaries
- RESTful http resources following JSON:API specification eases interpretation of the large number of attributes provided and eliminates dependencies to coap and DTLS.
- enables tracking of history on-demand

## New REST JSON:API resources

### `/api/actions`

A http client may send requests to the actions resource that trigger diagnostic requests into the Thread network or requests to a (on-mesh) commissioner for onboarding new devices onto the Thread network. Such requests typically may have a longer response time and results be obtained indirectly after some processing time.

This PR supports following action requests to `/api/actions`:

- POST
  - `addThreadDeviceTask` - starts the on-mesh commissioner and adds the joiner candidate into the joiner table
- GET | DELETE the full `actions` collection

A `DELETE` request on `api/actions` cancels a ongoing action and deletes all collection items.

### Examples of general resource features

The request must comprise a header field `Accept` set to `application/vnd.api+json` for JSON:API content format, or `application/json` for JSON content format in the response. Accordingly, the response comprises the header field `Content-type`.

#### Get collection

All items of the collection are gettable in a single request, e.g.

```
curl -G http://<otbr-address>/api/<collectionName> -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json'
```

#### Get collection item by id

Individual items are gettable from the collections, e.g.

```
curl -G http://<otbr-address>/api/<collectionName>/<itemId> -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json'
```

#### Get items by type

The collection can be filtered by type of the items, e.g.

```
curl -G http://<otbr-address>/api/<collectionName>?fields[<type>] -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json'
```

#### Get items by type with limited attributes

The collection can be filtered by type of the items, e.g.

```
curl -G http://<otbr-address>/api/<collectionName>?fields[<type>]=attribute1,attribute2 -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json'
```

Detailed request examples are provided in the test folder as a "Bruno Request Collection". Use the free opensource API client [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/).

# How to rebuild and experience this work

Please follow the following steps to install/build OTBR.

1. Checkout this PR

2. Build and Install OTBR as usual, e.g. on a Raspberry Pi

3. Restart the OTBR. `sudo systemctl restart otbr-agent`

4. To monitor the log [Errors|Warnings|Info] please open a different terminal instance and use following command:

```
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep otbr
```

5. Send POST request using BRUNO or CURL, e.g. to join a new device into your network.

```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json' http://localhost:8081/api/actions -d '{"data": [{"type": "addThreadDeviceTask", "attributes": {"eui": "6234567890AACDEA", "pskd": "J01NME", "timeout": 3600}}]}' | jq
```

should return

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "2d5a8844-b1bc-4f02-93f0-d87b8c3b4e92",
      "type": "addThreadDeviceTask",
      "attributes": {
        "eui": "6234567890AACDEB",
        "pskd": "J01NME",
        "timeout": 3600,
        "status": "pending"
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

6. You may check the status and get the full collection of actions.

```
curl -X GET -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' http://localhost:8081/api/actions | jq
```

should return

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "2d5a8844-b1bc-4f02-93f0-d87b8c3b4e92",
      "type": "addThreadDeviceTask",
      "attributes": {
        "eui": "6234567890AACDEB",
        "pskd": "J01NME",
        "timeout": 3600,
        "status": "pending"
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "collection": {
      "offset": 0,
      "limit": 100,
      "total": 1
    }
  }
}
```

7. View the entry added to the commissioner's table `sudo ot-ctl commissioner joiner table` and expect

```
| ID                    | PSKd                             | Expiration |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------+------------+
|      6234567890aacdea |                           J01NME |    3459027 |
Done
```

8. Start your joiner and after a few seconds repeat above steps 6. and 7.

9. For further experiencing the diagnostic endpoints, see the python demo test script `http_action_client_demo.py` or use the Bruno request collection, you find both in the folder [tests/restjsonapi](./../../../tests/restjsonapi).

10. For running the included test script install Bruno-Cli and run the bash script on your border router

```
cd tests/restjsonapi
source ./install_bruno_cli
./test-restjsonapi-server
```
